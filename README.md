# 🧠 nnue_repository

A repository for pre-trained **Efficiently Updatable Neural Networks (NNUE)** for chess engines and other games. ♟️  
This is a great entry point for machine learning enthusiasts to contribute. We believe in a strong open-source community that fosters collaboration and innovation.

## 📤 Contributing

To contribute a pretrained model:

1. **🍴 Fork this repository.**

2. **📁 Add your model to the `models/` directory**, including:
   - 📦 The model file  
   - 📝 A short `README.md` describing:
     - 🧱 **Architecture** (e.g., `768→256→32→1`)
     - 📄 **File format**: At a minimum, describe your file format. Including code for reading the model and performing inference is highly encouraged.
     - 📚 **Training dataset and method**: For example, if your network is trained on Leela data ([robotmoon.com](https://robotmoon.com/nnue-training-data/)), please provide appropriate attribution.
     - 📈 **Evaluation results**, such as Elo gains, if available.

3. **🚀 Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your contribution.

✅ Make sure your model is:

- 🔓 **Licensed** appropriately for open sharing  
- 🧪 **Tested and validated** to avoid corrupted or low-quality uploads


📢 If your chess engine uses a model from this repository, please provide **appropriate attribution** to the original contributors.
